Unofficial Weapon Pack Alpha VS1.18/1.19/1.20 update repack.
Because we loved using this mod on our server running on VS1.17, I made this unofficial repack to 1.18. There already is a fix version made by iowatt but his version collides with the Electricity mod, it causes some texture mismatch. So I decided to make this unofficial update.

EDIT 1/2024: Upgraded to .NET7 + repacked for 1.19
EDIT 1/2025: repacked for 1.20

All credits belongs to the author of the original Weapon Pack Alpha: Mr1k3. 

I was trying to contact Mr1k3 three different ways, but unfortunately no success Edit: Mr1k3 already answered. After long waiting for update I decided to make this repack, as we desperately miss this brilliant mod on our server.

This repack has it's own modid, but it uses all assets from the original mod.
So this mod can collide with iowatt's fix version as well as with the original mod!

Note that this mod will be deprecated as soon as Mr1k3 releases an official update!
Use it at your own risk.
